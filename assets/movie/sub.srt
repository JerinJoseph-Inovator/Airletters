00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,848
All right, move out!

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,544
Let's go! Move it out!

5
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,090
He's dead! He's dead!
Leave him! Come on, let's go!

6
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,429
<i>Dear Billy,
I'm so worried about you.</i>

7
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,140
<i>I miss you so much.
Why haven't you written me back?</i>

8
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,726
<i>I don't know
if this letter will get to you.</i>

9
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,269
<i>Praying for your safe return.</i>

10
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,939
<i>I miss you so much.
Why haven't you written me back?</i>

11
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,567
<i>Dear William, come back soon.
Is everything okay?</i>

12
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,028
<i>I've been overseas in this war
for over a year now.</i>

13
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,613
<i>Dear Daddy, I miss you so much.</i>

14
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,866
<i>My dearest Michael,
I am praying for your safe return.</i>

15
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,661
<i>I think of you,
and that is every day.</i>

16
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,329
<i>I miss you so very much.</i>

17
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,041
-  <i>Lately, it's been a long...</i>
-  <i>Here we are a short distance...</i>

18
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,627
<i>I've written two
or three times recently...</i>

19
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,671
<i>Lately, it's been a long time...</i>

20
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,800
<i>I'm so worried about you.
Why haven't you written to me?</i>

21
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,461
{\an8}Abram David, you must stop making
a spectacle of yourself

22
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,005
{\an8}by parading around with the likes--

23
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,464
{\an8}Mary Kathryn, don't you dare.

24
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,341
{\an8} It's not proper.
Quite frankly--

25
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,051
{\an8} Get out of her way.

26
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,720
{\an8} I will not.

27
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,015
{\an8}Okay. Well, fine.

28
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,518
{\an8}Lena, German U-boat, twelve o'clock low,
vector six niner, niner west.

29
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:18,943
{\an8}Go!

30
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,582
{\an8}Look out!

31
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,675
{\an8}Don't you worry, Miss Lena Derriecott,
nothing will harm you on my plane.

32
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,927
{\an8}Pull back on the stick!
German plane, three o'clock!

33
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,013
{\an8}Whoa!

34
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,113
{\an8}- Madam.
- Thank you.

35
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,574
{\an8}Abram David, you're gonna get me
in a world of trouble.

36
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,118
{\an8}- Oh, I'm sorry, but--
- I'm sure my mother is watching.

37
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,079
{\an8}Sorry, but we were on a combat mission.

38
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,290
{\an8}- We had to get away from the enemy.
- Mary Kathryn is no Hitler.

39
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,917
{\an8}Are you sure?

40
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,335
{\an8}That's not funny.

41
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,629
{\an8}You heard Edward R. Murrow
just like I did.

42
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,256
{\an8}He said Hitler is a monster.

43
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,218
{\an8}And that is exactly why
I'm going into the battle.

44
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,471
{\an8}Don't give me the long face.

45
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,973
{\an8}Just gonna miss you, that's all.

46
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,935
{\an8}- Can't believe you're going to the Army.
- Don't worry.

47
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,145
{\an8}You see how well I drive
this old Chevrolet?

48
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,440
{\an8}Getting my practice
for when I'm in the cockpit.

49
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,650
{\an8}Abram, this is serious.

50
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,236
{\an8}- I know you know that--
- Is this out of concern for my well-being?

51
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,239
{\an8}Or because we won't be able to make
Mary Kathryn and her friends

52
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,534
{\an8}turn green with envy every day?

53
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,082
{\an8}But, like, here's my thing...

54
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,502
{\an8} It's true.

55
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,503
{\an8}Come along now, Lena.

56
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,588
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

57
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,300
{\an8}- Hi, Mrs. Derriecott. Have a great day.
- You do the same, Abram.

58
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,264
{\an8}Don't you worry, Miss Lena.
I will write you every chance I get.

59
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,694
{\an8}I see that boy done dropped you off again.

60
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,071
{\an8}You mighty close to him.

61
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,073
{\an8}Something you wanna tell us?

62
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,452
{\an8}- Auntie, we are just friends.
- That better be all it is.

63
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,705
{\an8}Oh, Emma, she's soon to be 18.

64
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,457
{\an8}Going off to the university.

65
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,543
{\an8}There'll be a lot more boys there.

66
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,546
{\an8}Don't rush into nothing
like your mama did.

67
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,383
{\an8}Go on and get washed up.
We need you to help us tonight.

68
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,385
{\an8}Yes, ma'am.

69
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:50,927
{\an8}Lena?

70
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,804
{\an8}- Mm.
- You got the best attitude.

71
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,475
{\an8}Your mama here wants me to make
all the kosher meals and serve 'em too.

72
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,392
{\an8} Oh.

73
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,979
{\an8}And you'll be happy to know
that Mr. David has hired me

74
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
{\an8}to cater your boyfriend's party.

75
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,693
{\an8}He's not my boyfriend.

76
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,863
{\an8}Then why is you smiling?

77
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,873
{\an8}I wish you wouldn't fill her head
with that talk.

78
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,793
{\an8}That boy is Jewish.
That can't bit-mo be, and you know it.

79
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,630
{\an8}Oh, Emma, she just having fun.

80
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,466
{\an8}Well, she need to have fun
with a Negro boy.

81
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,845
{\an8}And on top of that, you talking schooling.

82
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,640
{\an8}You know we ain't got the money
to send her to that school.

83
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,645
{\an8}Well, we gonna get all the money we need
to send that girl to the university.

84
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,149
{\an8}Well, I sure would like
to see you do it, Susie.

85
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,996
Well, Rabbi Wise got an audience
with President Roosevelt.

86
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,706
We must do something
to help with the rescue.

87
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,043
Hitler has murdered two million Jews,

88
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,631
and I'm told women and children
are in that number.

89
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,799
So we can't just sit idly by.

90
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,554
We're leaning on every official we can
to get a humanitarian effort underway.

91
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,141
It's a horror
the imagination cannot grasp.

92
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,980
There were concentration camps.
Now there are extermination camps.

93
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,649
What a brave boy your Abram is.

94
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,652
Excuse me.

95
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,654
No, thank you, Lena.

96
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,573
Indeed, he is.

97
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,660
His desire was to be a Ritchie Boy,
but he's not fluent in German.

98
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,463
Finally. The place where you belong.

99
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,858
I can't stay long. This party is for you.
You should be in there.

100
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,402
Some going-away party.

101
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,739
All they're talking about
is how bad the war is.

102
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,245
Well... it is.

103
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,582
Right now,
I'd rather be out here with you.

104
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,087
I'm gonna miss you, Lena.

105
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,131
I'm gonna miss you too.

106
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:34,967
But...

107
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,471
But I better be going.

108
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,225
If my mother knew I was here,
I'd be as good as dead.

109
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,561
Well, at least you won't kill
Mary Kathryn.

110
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,691
She is a horrible person
for treating you that way

111
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,360
because of the color of your skin.

112
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,987
It's not the only reason.

113
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,657
She likes you.

114
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,661
She thinks we're courting,
even though we're not.

115
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,579
We're just...

116
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,081
friends.

117
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,004
Well, you tell that story
enough to others.

118
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe we started to believe it ourselves.

119
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,304
Kiss me.

120
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,393
I am not kissing you.
What are you saying--

121
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,770
<i>♪ You made me love you ♪</i>

122
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,439
<i>♪ I didn't wanna do it
I didn't wanna do it ♪</i>

123
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,149
You have the worst voice.

124
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,112
<i>♪ You made me want you
And all the time you knew it... ♪</i>

125
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,029
Stop it.

126
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,240
Stop it!

127
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,283
Gosh.

128
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,827
When you kiss me.

129
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,379
Lena Derriecott,

130
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,132
I'm in love with you.

131
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,010
And I know you feel the same way.

132
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,597
I'm gonna fight in this war, and...

133
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,813
I want you to wear this ring as a promise
that you will wait for me to return

134
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,025
so that we can start to acknowledge
what we have both denied for far too long.

135
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,822
You know this is not right
in the eyes of many people.

136
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,284
The only eyes that matter are ours.

137
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,748
Lena.

138
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,667
Ain't you supposed to be working?

139
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,085
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,545
The tray.

141
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,088
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,257
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,887
Hi, Mrs. Derriecott.

144
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,515
If you wanna court my daughter,

145
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,727
you show up at my house
like a proper gentleman

146
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,354
and ask me and her father.

147
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,815
Do you understand me?

148
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,734
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,904
And when I return from the war,

150
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,615
that'll be my first mission.

151
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,051
- Anything from my boys?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

152
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,039
-  Where you get that ring?
- Cracker Jack box.

153
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,545
Little girl!

154
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,505
Sorry, Mama.

155
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,302
He ain't been gone
no more than a few months.

156
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:10,224
Your husband been gone longer than that
with no word of where he is.

157
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,268
You watch yourself.

158
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,527
I guess she didn't get no mail.

159
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,198
And when they start putting rings
in Cracker Jack boxes?

160
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,910
<i>Thousands of WACs,
trained and disciplined the Army way,</i>

161
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,581
<i>are now on duty
all over this country and overseas.</i>

162
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,167
<i>But thousands more are needed.
Women from all walks of life.</i>

163
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,671
<i>Salesgirls,
industrial workers, librarians,</i>

164
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,464
<i>housewives, entertainers...</i>

165
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,009
- Put that away and pay attention, Lena.
- Yes, ma'am.

166
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,511
<i>...all creeds,
for the next big step in their new life.</i>

167
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,013
<i>Ready to serve with the Army,</i>

168
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,057
<i>to do the jobs
the Army thinks they do best.</i>

169
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,809
<i>Some do officers' training school...</i>

170
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,295
Excuse me?

171
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,089
Oh!

172
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,674
Sorry.

173
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:32,932
Mama?

174
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,854
Was that Mr. David's car?

175
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,814
Uh, come and sit.

176
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,864
Mr. David brought this by for you.

177
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,556
- Mama!
- I know, baby, I know.

178
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,095
She ain't talk much
at all for weeks.

179
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,139
Yeah, I know.

180
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,725
She just closed off.

181
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,728
That poor boy.

182
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,273
They've been knowing one another
since they were little.

183
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,360
Seemed like he just got there. Mm.

184
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:13,198
Well, I sure hope Lionel comes back
with money for her schooling.

185
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,368
At least we can give her that.

186
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,247
- Has he ever come back with any money?
- Don't do that.

187
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,001
Shh.

188
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
Thought you was sleeping.

189
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,714
Probably couldn't, huh?

190
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,763
Mama, I made a decision.

191
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,806
Okay.

192
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,061
After I graduate...

193
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,315
I'm going to join the Army.

194
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,777
I wanna fight Hitler.

195
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,201
Look at me, baby.

196
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,623
I know you are hurtin' about Abram.
We all are.

197
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,461
But that ain't no reason
for you to go to no Army.

198
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,046
And from what I hear tell,

199
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,382
ain't no Negro woman
doing nothing in no Army

200
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,719
but cooking and cleaning
for the white folks.

201
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,763
Hell, you can stay right here and do that.

202
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,974
You is going to that university.

203
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,185
With what money?

204
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,942
I'm going to join the Army...

205
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,987
as soon as I graduate.

206
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,199
That's what I'm gonna do.

207
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,494
- I don't have time, Mama.
-  You have plenty of time.

208
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,455
Stop fussing, Emma.
You're fussy, fussy, fussy.

209
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,375
- Well, I think this is me.
- Is that--?

210
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,254
Here. You take this.
And you be sure to eat, you hear?

211
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,298
Susie, she already said
that she can only have one suitcase,

212
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,259
and you've already put food in it.

213
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,220
You gonna have her clothes
smelling like pork and beans.

214
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,558
"Betty-Ann Morris. Susanne Jones."

215
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,308
"Lena Derriecott."

216
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,602
- Yes, sir. That's me.
-  It's time to board.

217
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,355
- We gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

218
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,815
We love you.

219
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,567
- I love you too.
- I love you.

220
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,570
- I'll write.
- Write me.

221
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,613
- Promise.
- Okay.

222
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,866
- Bye.
- Bye.

223
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,201
- Bye.
- Bye.

224
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,422
I hope she's gonna be safe.

225
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,506
She will.

226
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,383
All aboard!

227
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,012
Emma? You crying?

228
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,350
They ain't gonna let no Negro women
near Europe, let alone Hitler.

229
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:50,022
So you dry your eyes and come on.
She ain't going nowhere but to Georgia.

230
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,275
I need you all to come with me.

231
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,944
No, not you all.

232
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,781
You over there, let's go.

233
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,324
Are you coming?

234
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,036
Well, I'm assuming
you're separating the white women.

235
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,829
I am a Negro.

236
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,463
Well, we must done crossed
the Mason-Dixon Line.

237
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,215
Welcome to the South, ladies.

238
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,885
Segregation is just
in them crackers' blood.

239
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,264
You ain't said nothin'
since we been on this train.

240
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,307
What's your name?

241
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,852
Lena Derriecott. I'm from Philadelphia.

242
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,521
Johnnie Mae Burton, mine. You?

243
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,149
Bernice Baker. I'm from New York.

244
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,276
And what about you, Miss Mulatto?

245
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,028
She is not mulatto.

246
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,698
Her mother is Mexican,
and her father is a Negro.

247
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,326
He was my uncle. You are so rude.

248
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,411
I didn't mean no harm.

249
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,872
Sounded like that to me.

250
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm Dolores Washington.
This is my cousin, Elaine White.

251
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,417
How do you do?

252
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,336
Fine.

253
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,838
Well, I'm just a little tired.

254
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,758
Had to come up North and stay with my aunt
and her nine children in one room

255
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,218
just to get in the Army.

256
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,053
They wouldn't send me nowhere
in the South.

257
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,722
Elaine, myself,
and four other Negro women took the test.

258
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,057
We were told we all failed.

259
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,186
I have spent three years
at Spelman College, and--

260
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,647
And Dolores here is a whiz
who loves history.

261
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,359
So I knew that couldn't be.
So you know what she did?

262
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,446
She wrote a letter
directly to Mary McLeod Bethune.

263
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,740
The Mary McLeod Bethune?

264
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,366
Who is that?

265
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,911
Oh Lord. Where you from?

266
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,663
The country.

267
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,250
Mary McLeod Bethune is head
of the National Council of Negro Women.

268
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,127
She's on the president's Black cabinet,

269
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,589
and she's close personal friends
with Eleanor Roosevelt herself.

270
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,216
How am I supposed to know about a McLoud?

271
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,011
It's McLeod.

272
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,263
Y'all keep making fun of me.

273
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,222
Worse than my husband.

274
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,265
What are y'all waiting on?
Hurry up and get down from there.

275
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,810
You mean to tell me I left home to deal
with the same bullshit in the Army?

276
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,438
- How the hell we gonna get down?
- Come on.

277
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,398
We'll help you.

278
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,942
Ooh, I'm gonna like it here.

279
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,944
I'll help you.

280
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,582
Hi. I'm Hugh Bell.

281
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,084
Lena Derriecott.

282
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,880
Welcome. If you need anything at all,
I've been here a year.

283
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,591
I know a lot, and I could show you around.

284
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,053
You just gonna show her around?
We all wanna be showed around.

285
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,640
Ma'am.

286
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,475
All right, let's go. Ladies.

287
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,478
Lord, you can help me anytime, shit.

288
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:24,111
Johnnie Mae!
You should not use that language.

289
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,861
What, you a preacher?

290
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,114
My father is.

291
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,116
Hm. Lord, I just got out of hell
to come to another hell.

292
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,326
She trying to put me in a third hell.

293
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,038
- We're just--
- She gonna cover her ears up.

294
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,042
Make sure you have
your birth certificates in hand.

295
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,460
You all, come with me.

296
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,340
Right through there.

297
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,551
Right through that door.

298
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,637
Thank you.

299
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,645
One more meal,
and you'll be over the weight limit.

300
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,898
Roll up your sleeve
and get ready for your shot.

301
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,317
Next.

302
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,781
Damn, how long you gonna stick me?

303
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,004
How is this supposed to fit us?
I can't get my titties in this.

304
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,549
They are called breasts, Johnnie Mae.
Have some class.

305
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,260
Them little things you got
is called breasts.

306
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,387
This is Martha, this is Mary.

307
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,389
These are titties.

308
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,684
And they ain't going in this uniform.

309
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,897
Well, this ain't much.

310
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,193
Ah. Where'd you think you were going?
The Waldorf?

311
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,695
She gonna leave me alone.

312
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,450
Attention!

313
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,458
You will hear that a lot.

314
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,835
When you do,

315
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,546
line up in front of a bunk,

316
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,589
looking straight ahead.

317
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,842
Do it now! Let's go!

318
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,969
Attention!

319
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,571
Soldiers,

320
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,366
I am Captain Charity Adams,

321
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,285
and I will be your commanding officer.

322
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:42,706
What that means
is when I say "do it," you get it done.

323
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,835
There are rules for the Army,
and they must be abided.

324
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,338
And they are strict.

325
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:53,677
I expect you to follow them to the letter.
No exceptions. None will be tolerated.

326
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,306
We start training at 0630.
You have to be here at reveille.

327
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,601
If you are on time, you are late,
so you must be early.

328
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,606
Each of you has a locker and a trunk.

329
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,818
Everything you own
must fit inside those two items.

330
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,737
You will not wear complicated makeup.

331
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,281
You have to shave your legs.

332
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:19,493
You must use deodorant,
and you must shower at least once a day.

333
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,914
And if you do not know
how to use a tampon, we will teach you.

334
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,168
You have to stand up straight.

335
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,422
Posture is important.

336
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,925
We walk with our head up,

337
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,386
our back straight, and our butt in.

338
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,013
That is how we walk.

339
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,431
Your uniform must be perfect.

340
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,268
Lieutenant Campbell will teach you
how to make them perfect.

341
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,063
These uniforms were designed
for the pencil figure of a white woman,

342
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,690
not the curves of a Negro.

343
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,442
But I am sure that more than a few of us

344
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,485
know how to make use
of a needle and thread,

345
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,196
and so we will make them perfect.

346
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,240
They must be perfect.

347
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,491
No exceptions.

348
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,619
You are not only in the Army,

349
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,663
you are women, and you are Negroes.

350
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,248
Because you are Negroes and women,

351
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,501
you do not have the luxury
to be as good as the white soldiers.

352
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,630
You have the burden to be better.

353
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,256
You are not only representing America,

354
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,968
you are representing
the Negroes of America.

355
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,057
Welcome to the Women's Army Corps.

356
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,099
- Mrs. Roosevelt.
- Hello, George.

357
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,892
Where's my husband?

358
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,396
- He's in the Oval, in a meeting, ma'am.
- Very well.

359
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,272
George, who's that woman by the gates?

360
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,401
I'm not sure, ma'am.
She's been there for two days now.

361
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,403
Really?

362
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,862
What does she want?

363
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,408
I'm not sure.
Would you like me to find out, ma'am?

364
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,868
Yes, George. Thank you.

365
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,592
Look alive, ladies!

366
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,595
There are photographers around
at all times,

367
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,972
taking photos of you,

368
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,184
watching you, reportin' on you.

369
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,479
A lot of people do not want us to succeed.

370
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,065
A lot of people do not want us here.

371
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,569
Private, your hat is too high.

372
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,530
Unlike some other folks here,

373
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,075
we have the most to prove.

374
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:51,039
Now... now is where you show the proof.

375
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,585
I will not tolerate
fighting and bickering among you.

376
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,630
I will not tolerate disrespect.

377
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,549
I will not lie to you,

378
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,388
and you will not lie to me
without extreme consequences.

379
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,476
Get your arms up, Private!

380
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,565
Now, if you are thinking that
I am being hard on you, you are correct.

381
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,902
But that is because
I am giving you my best,

382
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,821
and you will give me yours.

383
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,281
I don't think that's your best, Private.

384
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,825
Get moving.

385
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,203
Stop!

386
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,497
You three.

387
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,333
You, you, and you, come here.

388
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,968
I need women soldiers
who know what it feels like to struggle.

389
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,012
Who, from the moment they were born,
have had to fight to survive.

390
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,889
This is your first strike.

391
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,767
Three, and you are out of here.

392
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,561
Am I clear?

393
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,980
Understand?

394
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,438
Yes, Captain.

395
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,607
Fall in line.

396
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,113
Let's go, ladies! Let's try this again!

397
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,574
Arms up!

398
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,577
Show me you have some fight in you!

399
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:17,833
Come on, ladies!
Are you at war, or are you taking a nap?

400
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,918
-  To the top!
-  Let's go!

401
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,046
Let's go! Pick up the pace!

402
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,463
Pick it up!

403
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,134
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

404
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,305
Let's go! Let's go! Pick up the pace!

405
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,431
Keep your heads down!

406
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,934
Let's go, ladies!

407
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,353
Pick up the pace!

408
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,229
Move, move, move!

409
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,939
- This is not a tea party!
- Let's go!

410
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,482
- Heads down!
-  Come on!

411
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,360
- I wanna see your best!
- Girl, move!

412
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,446
I don't wanna be looking up your tail!

413
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,575
You trying to get shot too?
I ain't going home 'cause of you.

414
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,328
Let's go! Let's go! Pick up the pace!

415
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,871
Come on, Lena, you can do this.

416
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,081
-  Let's go, ladies, let's go!
- Come on!

417
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,374
Come on!

418
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,335
Come on, ladies, give me your best!

419
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,419
Let's go!

420
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,928
Let's go, ladies!

421
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,703
George,
she's out there in the rain.

422
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,083
Did we find out what she wants?

423
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,836
She said she's been waiting
to see you, ma'am.

424
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,009
- Get me an umbrella, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

425
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,269
- George, cover her with your umbrella.
- Yes, ma'am.

426
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,147
Thank you, sir.

427
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,694
Hello. You are going to catch
a terrible cold out here.

428
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,905
- You've been out here for days.
- I was wanting to see you.

429
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,866
This must be very important.

430
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,742
I'm from West Virginia.

431
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:21,039
My husband is a coal miner,
and I know we're nobodies in this world.

432
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,083
No, everybody is somebody.

433
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,460
Well, I just don't know what else to do.

434
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:31,466
This is a photograph
of my son Vernon and his brother Elmer.

435
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,927
-  Oh, beautiful.
-  Thank you, ma'am.

436
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,096
They left to fight in the war
three years ago,

437
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,932
and I haven't heard from them since.

438
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,145
I don't know what to do.
I'm just worried out of my mind.

439
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,355
Well, you should write to them.

440
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,817
I write all the time,
but I never hear back.

441
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,111
No letters, nothing.

442
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,446
Why is that?

443
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,200
Mrs. Roosevelt,
this is happening all over the country.

444
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,329
We are not hearing from
or able to get word to them.

445
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,916
Well, this can't be.

446
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,753
Come on inside and tell me all about it.

447
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,131
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

448
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,187
What the hell?

449
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,439
Girl, what have you done to your breasts?

450
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,400
I bound them. That's the only way
they're gonna fit in this uniform.

451
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,445
Elaine, you can sew real well.
Can you fix it for her?

452
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,491
Uh-uh. I don't want her
doing nothing for me.

453
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,869
You hush. Give me the shirt.

454
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,873
My feet hurt so bad.
It's worse than working in a cotton mill.

455
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,542
I thought coming here
would be a little change from that.

456
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,960
Is that why you came?

457
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,673
That, and that nigga hit me
one too many time.

458
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,717
Language!

459
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,553
Why did you come?

460
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,890
I wanna go to school
and at the same time help our country.

461
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,267
Same.
I'd like to get my master's in history.

462
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,438
I don't know about helping no country
that treat us like shit.

463
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,650
You got to lighten up,
preacher's daughter.

464
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,238
Johnnie Mae,
I have always been a proper young lady.

465
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,658
You should try it.
You shouldn't be using that language.

466
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,036
Well, you go on and be
who the preacher taught you to be.

467
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,539
I'm gonna be Johnnie Mae.

468
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,374
If you're angry with your country,
why be here?

469
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,418
Ain't no jobs for me
but working in a field, cotton mill,

470
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,879
or some white folk kitchen.

471
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,256
So I said I might as well.

472
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,634
- Lena. Why did you come?
- Hm?

473
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,638
I wanna help my country too.

474
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,849
I wanna fight Hitler.

475
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,353
Lord, chile,
I don't believe that, not one bit.

476
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,605
What?

477
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:54,025
Hey, ladies, why did y'all come here?

478
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,987
- Draft was gonna take my fiancé.
-  Fight for my country.

479
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,240
Girl, shoot, I'm trying to bring
my husband home soon.

480
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,577
-  Wasn't nothing for me in Texas.
-  I wanted to go to school.

481
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,037
-  Me too.
-  I wanted to travel the world.

482
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:09,708
Good luck with that.
Y'all made it to Georgia.

483
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,463
Now, while some of y'all lying,

484
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,717
I'm gonna tell y'all
the real reason why I came.

485
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,634
Why?

486
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,429
For the men.

487
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:37,319
They are sending
another white unit to Europe?

488
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,030
Yes, I can see that, Lieutenant.

489
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,490
And you know
they are not half as qualified.

490
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,742
I know.

491
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,494
I've been asking for orders.

492
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,079
We can't be doing all this in vain,

493
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,751
but I don't know what else to do
to show them we are ready.

494
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,821
This right here is not helping.

495
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,409
Get up on your feet!

496
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,663
Now, Miss Lena.
This is no way to get to fight Hitler.

497
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,831
You have to be strong.

498
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,583
- Come on, you can do it.
- Get up!

499
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,168
- I'm trying.
- Not...

500
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,254
<i>...</i> hard enough!

501
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,217
You are embarrassing your entire race.

502
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,261
They are already of the opinion

503
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,806
that the Negro woman
is dumb, inferior, and lazy.

504
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,559
And I'll be damned if I allow a woman
in my unit to prove them correct.

505
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,272
Now you answer my question.
Are you dumb or inferior or lazy?

506
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,439
No, ma'am.

507
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,442
Well then, do you just wanna go home?

508
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,903
- No, ma'am. I have to stay here.
- Why?

509
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,074
I wanna fight for my country.

510
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,993
You wanna fight?

511
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,036
You don't look like a fighter
down on this ground.

512
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,247
You look like a child
who doesn't have what it takes

513
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,250
to be in a unit
full of strong women soldiers.

514
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,252
This is your second strike.

515
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,046
Now, you get on up,
or you are out of here today.

516
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,257
Hey, Lena, does she remind you of anybody?

517
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,885
Mary Kathryn.

518
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,054
And we know what to do with her.

519
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,890
Vector.

520
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,226
Niner.

521
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,853
Niner west.

522
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,105
Get on up, soldier.

523
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,415
You better eat.
You're gonna need your strength.

524
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,083
She's right, Lena.

525
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,795
She should just go on and quit.
Captain Adams don't like her anyway.

526
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,467
- Why would you say that to her?
- It's true. She don't.

527
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,720
- You are not a nice person at all.
- I'm honest.

528
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,224
Don't you listen to her.
You're gonna make it. You will.

529
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,019
And he always looking at you.

530
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,979
Johnnie Mae, are you jealous of her?

531
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,983
Girl, hush.
If I wanted him, I could have him.

532
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,362
I ain't jealous of her skinny tail.
She ain't worried about him no way.

533
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,366
Only thing she think about is that Abram.

534
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,537
What did you say?

535
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,500
I bunk next to you.
You call his name every night.

536
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,251
Hell, I can't get no sleep.

537
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,836
Abram this, Abram that.

538
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,547
"Where are you, Abram? Abram, where are--"

539
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,134
Don't you dare mention his name again.

540
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:53,515
Now, I have let you push me around
and say all kinds of things,

541
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,518
but don't you dare say his name.

542
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,525
- You deserved that.
-  Mm-hmm.

543
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,077
This is the office of Colonel Davenport.
May I take a message?

544
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,870
<i>...jobs the Army way now begins.</i>

545
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,623
<i>WACs, fit, alert, proud of their corps,</i>

546
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,042
<i>prepared for the next big step
in their new life.</i>

547
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,420
<i>Replacing soldiers at switchboards.</i>

548
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,256
<i>Serving as dispatchers
for various branches of the Army.</i>

549
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,842
<i>Motor transport,
where women have proved their ability</i>

550
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,760
<i>to maintain and repair cars and trucks.</i>

551
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,846
<i>They're good drivers and mechanics.</i>

552
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,305
<i>In Army motor pools.</i>

553
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:38,184
<i>In these and many other fields,
taking over important jobs for the Army.</i>

554
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:42,231
<i>Through these replacements,
playing a vital role in winning the war.</i>

555
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:50,906
At ease.

556
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,500
- You wanted to see me, Adams?
- Yes, sir.

557
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,794
I know you are persistent.

558
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,922
If this has anything to do
with you having orders--

559
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,133
It does, sir.

560
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,093
I have graduated hundreds of women,

561
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,888
and this month,
another 38 are about to do the same.

562
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:19,435
As you know, I have a 97% success rate.
We are ready to be called to duty, sir.

563
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,688
Are you sure about that?

564
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,817
I don't think you're ready
for an assignment.

565
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,570
Sir, with all due respect,
the white women--

566
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,739
They're more qualified.

567
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,534
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

568
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,078
- Sir, I--
- I have a meeting.

569
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,456
Yes, sir.

570
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,590
She is--

571
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,221
Gentlemen, you know my wife.

572
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,724
And this is Mary McLeod Bethune.

573
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,351
Please be seated.

574
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,352
I'll get right down to it.

575
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,561
Over the past few weeks,

576
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:08,608
my wife and I have been talking about
the problems we are having with the mail

577
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,320
and our soldiers' morale.

578
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,821
Care to explain?

579
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,033
There has been
a serious blockage in the mail,

580
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,703
simply because we have needed
every available vehicle

581
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,082
to bring supplies to the front lines.

582
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:27,043
General Halt here can speak
to the magnitude of the issue.

583
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,087
- General?
-  Uh, yes, sir.

584
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:33,676
Now, Mr. President, helping our soldiers
win the war is our priority.

585
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,677
Um...

586
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:40,056
The mail had to take
a lesser rank of importance.

587
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,724
I understand that.

588
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,228
What I don't understand
is how anyone in this room

589
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:50,149
cannot see the importance of something
as simple as a letter from home

590
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,360
and what it can do for morale.

591
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,989
This is the only way they can communicate
outside of the battle.

592
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,285
But the orders at hand
are the most important ones,

593
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,828
for the supplies for the front lines.

594
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,164
So are you saying to me

595
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,502
that there is no way
to get the mail to these men?

596
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,755
That is unacceptable.

597
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,216
Mary.

598
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,594
As I travel the country,

599
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,223
these are the same stories
I hear everywhere.

600
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,768
Worried parents, wives,

601
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,478
children, loved ones,

602
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:31,149
all wondering
why they haven't received any mail.

603
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,360
Not one letter or so much as a postcard

604
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,030
from the men
who've been fighting for our country--

605
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,656
Mr. President, I can assure you

606
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:43,286
that we have, uh, put many companies
on this assignment,

607
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,581
but it has proven to be
a logistical nightmare at this point.

608
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,294
We even tried the Women's Army Corps.

609
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,548
You mean the white Women's Army Corps?

610
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,594
Well, is there another?

611
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,810
Are you not aware, General,

612
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,440
there are Negro women serving
in the Women's Army Corps?

613
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,569
But this mail situation is complicated.

614
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,406
Not as simple as just dropping
some letters in the mailbox.

615
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,660
There are reasons
for the backlog that are there.

616
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,706
Well, it'd require a great deal of skill

617
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,292
to be able to sort it all out.

618
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,753
With all due respect, General,

619
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:39,343
the Negro women of the Women's Army Corps
are very smart women,

620
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,013
being led by a remarkable Negro woman,

621
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,015
Captain Charity Adams.

622
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,475
She's brilliant.

623
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:51,897
She has a triple major
in physics, mathematics, Latin.

624
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,774
So I assure you, Mr. President,

625
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,568
the Negro women of the WAC unit

626
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:01,448
possess the skills and the leadership

627
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,785
to get this mail delivered.

628
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,670
There he is!

629
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,506
Ooh.
You go on, we'll hold you a seat.

630
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,675
Do you like him?

631
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,634
Seems nice enough.

632
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,095
She like him.
But he ain't that boy back home.

633
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,139
- Don't you say his name.
- I ain't.

634
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,766
Go on, talk to him.

635
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,853
Hey, Private.

636
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,105
Hello, ladies.

637
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:35,816
Hi.

638
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,693
Good to see you come out
and have some fun.

639
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,695
I've been hoping
to see you here for weeks.

640
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,448
And congratulations on making it through.

641
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,577
Barely. I'm still not as good
as the other ladies.

642
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,996
I think you're stronger than you know.

643
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,123
Thank you.

644
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,541
But you don't know me.

645
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,170
- I know your name is Lena Derriecott.
- Mm.

646
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,047
Came from a town outside Philadelphia.

647
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,218
You like jasmine perfume,
and you don't like milk.

648
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,262
You add up the pounds of fuel
really fast on the airplane,

649
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,848
and you know a lot about them.

650
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,894
And you are here to prove something
to more than just yourself.

651
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,189
How do you know all of that?

652
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,107
It's just...

653
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,109
when a man like me sees a woman

654
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,738
who makes him question
his next big decisions,

655
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,948
I wanna find out why.

656
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,659
What are you talking about?

657
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,537
This is gonna sound crazy,

658
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,748
but I'm supposed to get married
next weekend.

659
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,043
I wasn't sure about it at all,

660
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,836
and then I saw you.
Now I'm really not sure.

661
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,340
My mother and my aunt told me
about men like you, smooth talkers.

662
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,884
Excuse me.

663
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,096
I promise I'm telling you
the truth, Miss Lena.

664
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,724
Can we sit together inside?

665
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,526
Now, what are y'all doing here?

666
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,654
Well, it looks to me
like we are about to watch a movie.

667
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,989
Not from these seats.

668
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,407
They can all go to the back.

669
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:13,329
Well now, I am an officer,
and I chose these seats.

670
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,957
My ladies are not moving,
Captain Matthews.

671
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,084
Mm. I heard about you.

672
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,379
- Mm.
- You're the troublemaker.

673
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,674
Always trying to find a fight.

674
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,342
Always ready for one.

675
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,718
Hm.

676
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,639
We are not moving.
You all can sit in the back.

677
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,018
We don't need to listen
to the likes of you, nigger.

678
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,688
You son of a bitch! I will--

679
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,940
You will do nothing.

680
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,692
<i>...of which Germany
gambled everything.</i>

681
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,651
Sit down.

682
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,945
Come on, boys.
Let's leave these coons.

683
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:50,157
No. I don't know who you think you are,
but this is the United States Army.

684
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,410
I will not have this disrespect.
Give me your name!

685
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,705
Who the hell do you think you are?

686
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,584
I am Captain Charity Adams,

687
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,963
and you will salute me.

688
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,966
That ain't never gonna happen.

689
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,265
Get my hat.

690
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,058
You!

691
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,103
I'm sorry, Captain Adams.

692
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,690
It's just when them crackers
be coming at me, I just see red.

693
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,234
You don't think
we all feel that way sometimes?

694
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,696
I don't care what they do.
You don't let them bait you.

695
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,200
Because you in this uniform,
you must behave!

696
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,911
They will be court-martialed,

697
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,165
but you can never ever give them
what they want.

698
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,502
Adams. What is it?

699
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,463
Sir, my ladies were harassed

700
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,798
and asked to move from their seats
at the theater.

701
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,176
Several white soldiers,
including Captain Matthews,

702
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,428
were insulting and disrespectful.

703
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,138
I will not stand for this bigotry.

704
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,223
We have the same rights
as any white soldier.

705
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,645
- Anything less is inexcusable.
- Can you give it a rest?

706
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,940
Sir, with all due respect,
we are treated like--

707
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,982
I have orders for you.

708
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,526
You and the Six Triple Eight Battalion
are headed to Europe.

709
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,111
You'll head out tomorrow by plane,

710
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,614
and your troops
will arrive by boat on the 11th.

711
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,908
Here are your orders.

712
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:17,454
You are not to open this until you are
on the plane and over the Atlantic.

713
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,749
Dismissed.

714
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,671
Susie!

715
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,425
- You lied to me.
- What?

716
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,678
They are shipping Lena to Europe.

717
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,596
What?

718
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,306
There.

719
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,652
It's a lot of water.

720
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,367
How are you so calm? You been drinking?

721
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,327
No.

722
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,538
I was about to say, "Give me some."

723
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,919
Should you open it?

724
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,089
Well, I don't wanna be the first one.

725
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,635
And all of them have two envelopes,
but we only have one.

726
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,263
I can't figure out
what the other one says.

727
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,143
One's from the Army...

728
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,103
Abbie.

729
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,855
...one's from the War Department.

730
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,819
They're sending us without proper orders
from the War Department?

731
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,739
Looks that way to me.

732
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,699
You can't command troops unless you have--

733
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,326
War Department orders. I know.

734
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:42,831
There.

735
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,215
The Postal Battalion?

736
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:58,221
They think the only thing we good for
is deliver some damn mail.

737
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,515
Shit.

738
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,312
So they have a Negro at the Oval Office,

739
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,523
telling me these women
could do this job.

740
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:14,820
I tell you, took all I had
to keep myself together.

741
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:21,369
I mean, they think a bunch
of Negro women can do this job?

742
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,832
They have to be reasonably intelligent.

743
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,250
Reasonably.

744
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:32,089
And I never seen a smart Negro,

745
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,299
let alone a woman one.

746
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,719
Well, they have arrived, sir.

747
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,221
Oh well, go get 'em.

748
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,473
It's your idea to give them a reception.

749
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,642
Anything that can get me drinking.

750
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,186
General, this is Major Charity Adams.

751
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,146
At ease.

752
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,565
So...

753
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,945
you're the infamous Adams.

754
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,905
I don't know about infamous, sir.

755
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,199
Oh no.

756
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:04,537
I heard about your antics
at the base around, uh, integration,

757
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,288
drinking at white fountains,

758
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,707
the thing at the Post Theater, and so on.

759
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,418
Now they promoted you to major.

760
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,046
- So do you know why you're here?
- Yes, sir.

761
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,882
Although I still have not gotten orders
from the War Department, sir.

762
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,469
No, never mind that. They'll come.
I was talking about the assignment.

763
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,474
Yes, sir. We were told we are here
to redirect the mail, sir?

764
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,601
And y'all are confident
that, uh, you can do the job

765
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:31,481
in the short six months we've allotted?

766
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,652
Six months seems generous, sir,
so yes, I believe we can.

767
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,736
Well, you hear that, gentlemen?

768
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,864
They can do it.

769
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,324
Six months is generous.

770
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,910
And your troops are, uh, on the way.

771
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:49,623
They're on the Île de France,
so they're comfortable.

772
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,084
It's a very nice ship.

773
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,504
It can, uh, turn on a dime

774
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,840
if a German U-boat was in the area,
or any other danger.

775
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,924
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

776
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,636
And it can outmaneuver, quickly,

777
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,306
an incoming torpedo.

778
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,101
Well, sir, I'm sure between that
and their escorts,

779
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,352
I'm sure they will get here safely.

780
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,563
There's no escorts.

781
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:16,192
And unfortunately, the, uh, place
where your troops were to be housed

782
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,694
was, uh, bombed just before your arrival.

783
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,778
But don't you worry,

784
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,323
I personally approved accommodations

785
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:26,493
that I'm sure you gonna find appropriate.

786
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,661
Thank you, sir.

787
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,998
Can the troops march?

788
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,291
Yes, sir.

789
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,462
I have the best marching troop
you have ever seen, sir.

790
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,843
Your troops will be marching off the ship
upon their arrival.

791
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,723
Come on, Lee.

792
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,424
What does all this tossing and turning
remind you of?

793
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,010
You,

794
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,514
driving me in the back
of that rumble seat.

795
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,267
We had so much fun.

796
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,645
I knew you'd make it through.

797
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,940
I also knew you'd come to find me.

798
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,486
You can be determined when you want to,
Miss Lena Derriecott.

799
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,074
I miss you so much, Abram.

800
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,246
Hey, Lena,
hurry up with those towels.

801
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,565
Oh my God!

802
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:27,990
<i>We have 855 women
on a civilian ship,</i>

803
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,868
no military escort,
zigzagging across the ocean,

804
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,246
and he wants them to march right off?

805
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,622
Lord Jesus.

806
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,042
Noel, I asked for a mission.

807
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,377
Well, it don't seem like
we ever gonna get a chance...

808
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,587
Mm.

809
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,963
...to prove 'em wrong.

810
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:47,385
Especially not with something
as easy as delivering mail.

811
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,179
And giving us six months to do it.

812
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,473
That's because
they don't believe we can do it.

813
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,891
These white men.

814
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,392
Negro men too.

815
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,727
Like Howard.

816
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,520
Oh, please don't mention him.

817
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,107
- I'm trying to forget him.
- Oh, girl, don't mention him.

818
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:06,195
He was the worst mistake
I ever made in my life.

819
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,907
What we looked like,

820
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:14,995
sneaking out of the barracks
to catch him at the movies with...

821
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:19,750
Norma Jean. Your nemesis.

822
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,796
She was such a tramp.

823
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,756
You were so mad when you saw him.

824
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:29,593
I looked at the back of your head,
you still had a roller in it.

825
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,012
See...

826
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:39,562
Charity, you know those generals
were laughing for a reason, right?

827
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,356
Mm-hm. Showing his whole hand.

828
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,944
- And six months to seem generous?
- Mm.

829
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,487
Yeah.

830
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,448
Noel.
Hm?

831
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,660
Oh, Noel,
where did they say that mail was?

832
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,086
- Good evening, soldiers.
- Can I help you, ma'am?

833
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,677
You will salute.

834
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:13,972
Sorry, ma'am.

835
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,100
So where's this mail?

836
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,102
There's some in here.

837
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,731
Well, soldiers, open the door.

838
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,162
Would you like to see
all the hangars?

839
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,414
They are all this full.

840
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,624
How many are there?

841
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,043
All of them.

842
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,091
Oh my God.

843
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,944
You trained them well.

844
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,697
Fall in!

845
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,124
Six Triple Eight Battalion!

846
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,419
Dress right, dress!

847
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,885
Ready, two.

848
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,304
Cover!

849
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,392
Ready, two!

850
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,066
Now, I know you had a hard way over...

851
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,529
and I know you're cold.

852
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,407
Truth is, it will be cold.

853
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,787
But we need to put all of that
out of our minds

854
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:08,086
because we have been given an order
by General Halt to march today.

855
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,130
Right now.

856
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,176
And march we shall.

857
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,387
Captain!

858
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,321
Forward march!

859
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,549
Company, halt!

860
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,224
Battalion, eyes right!

861
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,061
Present arm!

862
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,068
Ready, two!

863
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,738
Battalion, forward march!

864
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:47,412
This mail has been sitting here
for over ten months.

865
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,624
And not just in this airplane hangar,

866
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,209
in all of them.

867
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,797
Every single hangar is full of mail.

868
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,593
The soldiers who are fighting this war
have not heard from their loved ones,

869
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,347
and their loved ones
have not heard from them.

870
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,060
Now, the War Department
is getting thousands of complaints,

871
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,397
and the morale of our soldiers
is at an all-time low.

872
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:19,235
And if our soldiers have low morale,
they have no fight.

873
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:26,659
Ladies, we have been ordered
to provide hope

874
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,703
and communication

875
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,497
and care packages

876
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,959
to our exhausted soldiers
on the front lines

877
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,131
and to let their families back home
know if they are safe.

878
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,550
Or...

879
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,387
Or if they have died in battle.

880
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,392
Now, I'm told

881
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:56,481
that a few have tried
to unravel this situation.

882
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,026
But they could not do it...

883
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,488
so they sent us.

884
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:08,242
But make no mistake, ladies,

885
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,663
they did not send us
because they thought we could do it.

886
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:18,294
We are here
because they are sure we cannot.

887
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,757
They have only given us
a six-month ticking clock.

888
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,550
And I thought that was a long time

889
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:29,972
until I realized
the magnitude of this situation.

890
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:34,392
When there is no mail,
there is low morale.

891
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,311
But all that said...

892
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:42,568
...this is our mission,

893
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,030
and we will not fail.

894
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,574
<i>Here's how
we will accomplish our mission.</i>

895
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,868
<i>Our drivers will come here to the hangar.</i>

896
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,162
<i>They will pick up the mail
and load it onto the trucks</i>

897
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,956
<i>according to Army number.</i>

898
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,708
<i>It will then be delivered
to our home base,</i>

899
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,919
<i>which is the King Edward School.</i>

900
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,546
<i>I wanna warn you,</i>

901
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:06,591
<i>there's no need to complain
because I know about the vermin.</i>

902
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,512
<i>I know that it is cold. There is no heat.</i>

903
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,597
<i>But I also know that we are at war,</i>

904
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:15,643
<i>and when you are at war, you make do.</i>

905
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,274
We are no strangers
to making a shack a home.

906
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,818
Most of our mothers
have had to do it as well.

907
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:29,615
So we will start by organizing a system
by which we process all this mail.

908
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,994
And this is where we gonna do it.

909
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,009
Now, as drivers,
you never ever leave this route.

910
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,094
This is your way to and from the airfield.

911
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:07,087
"It is hereby known
that Major Charity Adams

912
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:10,298
is in full command
of the Six Triple Eight Battalion."

913
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:14,177
- You finally got the orders?
- No. I got to thinking.

914
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:17,347
They don't wanna give me orders
'cause they want us to be chaotic.

915
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,850
I'm not waiting for them to tell me.
I'm telling them I took command.

916
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:22,477
I wrote it myself.

917
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,813
Send it in, Captain.

918
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,023
Yes, ma'am.

919
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:30,860
<i>♪ This is the name of this song
It's called "Air Mail Special" ♪</i>

920
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:35,156
<i>♪ Get on, get on
The special cargo air mail ♪</i>

921
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:57,930
Bring it in!

922
01:06:58,931 --> 01:06:59,890
Let's go!

923
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:08,899
You know you're still calling that name
I'm not allowed to say again.

924
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,700
I know some of you think
that this is impossible,

925
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,329
but there is only one way
to eat an elephant,

926
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:26,708
and that is one bite at a time.

927
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,196
Lena, you don't have to read
every name, you know.

928
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,033
Look at the numbers.
That's the best way to get it organized.

929
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,161
Oh.

930
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:14,632
Hey!

931
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,635
You don't do that.

932
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,059
You don't just throw them over there.

933
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,646
Those people have died!

934
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,525
They need to be shown some respect.

935
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,666
I'm sorry, Major Adams.

936
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,919
May I please go to the latrine?

937
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,547
You may.

938
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,177
Back to work, ladies.

939
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,602
I told you she was crazy.

940
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:12,981
Been quiet as a mouse this whole time,
and now she wants to start screaming?

941
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,234
She ain't gonna be hollering
at Johnnie Mae.

942
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:16,986
You know what? I...

943
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,613
I think I need to use the bathroom.

944
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,703
Well, y'all gonna get in trouble.

945
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,247
I ain't following that crazy tail
to the bathroom.

946
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:43,052
- Lena?
- Ah.

947
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,013
I'm all right.

948
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,557
Doesn't look that way to me.

949
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,601
Dry your eyes.

950
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:53,772
I have to pee.

951
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,567
You sure you're all right?

952
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,902
No. It's that man.

953
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:01,613
What'd he do? Break your heart
like my husband broke mine?

954
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,199
Will you stop it?

955
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,160
He's dead.

956
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,833
He was, uh...

957
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,253
shot down

958
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,340
not long after he got here.

959
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,638
He was a soldier...

960
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,227
and he asked me
to wait for him to come home.

961
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,650
I am so sorry.

962
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:42,863
Oh God, I feel like a clock
that nobody can wind.

963
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,994
I mean, he promised me
that he would write,

964
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,039
and I never got any letters.

965
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,626
I know he did.

966
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:03,300
I wonder if his letters to me
are in one of these bags.

967
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:07,929
But I didn't know
we were gonna be doing all this.

968
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,481
Oh, Lena. I'm so sorry.

969
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,067
I wanna thank y'all.

970
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,739
I know you didn't know, but thank you...

971
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,951
for helping me through this.

972
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,077
Honey, you listen here.

973
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,581
If there is a letter from him,
we will find it.

974
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,964
We will all be looking
for anything addressed to you.

975
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:47,093
It ain't no damn way
all these letters-- I'm so--

976
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,263
You all had to go at the same time?

977
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:52,016
- Sorry, Major Adams.
-  Mm-hmm.

978
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,519
Not you.

979
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,274
I know...

980
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,195
that you don't like me...

981
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,116
'cause I embarrass the unit.

982
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,370
But I promise you...

983
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,708
I will do a great job with this.

984
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,256
I know what these families
are going through.

985
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:27,176
There's nothing worse than not knowing.

986
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,846
- You're wrong.
- I promise you, I will--

987
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,640
About me not liking you.

988
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,561
I like you.

989
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,897
And I respect you.

990
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,483
Now, in the beginning,

991
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,361
I did worry about you.

992
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:47,987
I wondered if you would make it through.

993
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:50,573
But, Lena,
right when you were about to break,

994
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:53,243
something showed up and took you further.

995
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,498
And now I see what that was.

996
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,795
Lena, you are a soldier.

997
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,217
Now, Private,

998
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:12,136
I take seriously every order
I have ever gotten in the Army,

999
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,471
including this one,

1000
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,431
but I will admit to you

1001
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:17,850
that I was insulted at first

1002
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,145
that they would only let us
handle the mail.

1003
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,317
But I understand now.

1004
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:34,367
Because I knew that it was important
for our soldiers and their families,

1005
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:38,872
but nothing has put a face on this for me...

1006
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,834
like you have with what you shared today.

1007
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:48,549
Thank you.

1008
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,970
- Now get back to work.
- Yes, Major.

1009
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:54,888
Mm-hmm.

1010
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:07,108
"We are two months
into our six-month clock."

1011
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:10,653
"Major Adams, I do not need to tell you
how important this mission is."

1012
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:13,906
"There are a lot of people
counting on you and these women."

1013
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:16,075
"For what it's worth,
I know you can do this."

1014
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:19,620
"But this is not--" In all capitals.

1015
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,621
"Not the way."

1016
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,623
"General Halt was delighted to hear

1017
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,209
that every piece of mail
you have gotten out in the past few weeks

1018
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,963
has been returned as undeliverable."

1019
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,217
"He is sending telegrams
to the White House every day

1020
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:36,012
on your progress or lack thereof."

1021
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,305
Shit.

1022
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,765
I'm sure he is, General Halt.

1023
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,977
We sent out 57,000 pieces of mail.

1024
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,397
Yes, and all of them undeliverable.

1025
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:50,860
But, Charity, the soldiers
are moving around a lot in these battles.

1026
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,280
You think they gave us bad locator cards?

1027
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,575
Well, I know
they're not trying to help us.

1028
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:03,498
For just once, I'd like to play
on an even playing field

1029
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,874
where everything is fair.

1030
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:08,169
No tricks from white folks, just fairness.
Is fair too much to ask for?

1031
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,838
No, it is not.

1032
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:14,592
But you and I both know
it ain't gonna change no time soon.

1033
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,637
This is part of making that change.

1034
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,639
Did you see this last sentence?

1035
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,182
"I reluctantly need to tell you

1036
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,602
that he also wants you to host
the Negro soldiers on the weekends."

1037
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,606
I look like a hostess to you?

1038
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,345
Wow, how does she do that?

1039
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,723
She was a Whitney Lenny stepper in Harlem.

1040
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,099
Look at her go!

1041
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,569
Hey, okay!

1042
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:06,663
Lord, I need me some of this fun.

1043
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:08,624
Johnnie Mae!

1044
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,513
- She is incorrigible.
- She is quite confident.

1045
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,058
I was gonna say a mess. I'm tired.

1046
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,559
You're amazing.

1047
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,894
- So good.
- Thank you.

1048
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,480
Come on, I want a drink.

1049
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:35,024
- Come on, Lena.
- Well, I've never had a drink.

1050
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,192
Neither have I.

1051
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,527
And I didn't join the Army
to lose my dignity.

1052
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,112
That is the devil's brew.

1053
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:41,364
Looks like tonight...

1054
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,324
- Yes!
- ...we're all gonna get some of that brew.

1055
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,450
Come on, it'll be fun!

1056
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,131
- I'mma get you a drink.
- I don't know if I should.

1057
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:02,678
Oh come on, you need to relax.
You can't sit in your office all day.

1058
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:08,057
- There's some soldiers over there.
- Yeah, but I outrank them all.

1059
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,268
Not all of them.
You're looking the wrong way.

1060
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,981
Come on. He's a lieutenant colonel.

1061
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,068
- Hi.
- Hi.

1062
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:21,697
Hi.

1063
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,075
You don't seem surprised to see me.

1064
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,161
Not really.

1065
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:35,167
Well, when I heard about tonight,
I had to come keep an eye on my best girl.

1066
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:38,171
Mm. Wouldn't that be your wife at home?

1067
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,299
I didn't do it.

1068
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,844
You didn't do what?

1069
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:45,803
I didn't marry her.

1070
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:46,722
Why not?

1071
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,265
Because I met you.

1072
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,977
I'm not falling for this.

1073
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:56,523
Why do you think I'm trying to get you
to fall for something?

1074
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,027
Can I have this dance?

1075
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:36,855
I love this song.

1076
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:43,444
<i>♪ You made me love you ♪</i>

1077
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,863
<i>♪ I didn't wanna do it ♪</i>

1078
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,198
<i>♪ I didn't wanna do it... ♪</i>

1079
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,449
You have the worst voice.

1080
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,366
<i>♪ You made me... ♪</i>

1081
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,368
♪ ...<i>want-- ♪</i>

1082
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,771
Was it something I said?

1083
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,524
No, I, uh...

1084
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,401
I just, um...

1085
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:30,408
All right, you tell me something
that's going on with you,

1086
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:33,620
and I'll tell you something
that's going on with me.

1087
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,626
Well, the things I've seen
since I've been here

1088
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,128
have shook me something awful.

1089
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,840
You've been to the front lines?

1090
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,092
To deliver supplies.

1091
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:51,179
How bad is it?

1092
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,601
You can't imagine.

1093
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,523
But seeing you here tonight...

1094
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:05,819
you're a sight for sore eyes.

1095
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,572
I know I don't know you...

1096
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,950
but I'd like to get to know you.

1097
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,120
I'd like you to get to know me.

1098
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:18,248
I'm sorry.

1099
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,587
And as much as
I'd like to get to know you, I...

1100
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:31,761
I'm still so scattered in my head
and my heart about somebody that I lost.

1101
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:34,723
So...

1102
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:40,228
I don't think
I have anything to give to you.

1103
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,946
Um...

1104
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,324
You can give me friendship.

1105
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:55,327
That I can do.

1106
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:00,123
We sure need that over here.

1107
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,544
I'm sorry you're so sad.

1108
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,426
And I'm sorry for your loss.

1109
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,391
Now, ain't you cold out here?

1110
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,644
Yeah, it's cold.

1111
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:22,187
Come on.

1112
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,655
Excuse me?

1113
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:33,822
- Yes?
- I'm Clemens.

1114
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:36,158
- I'm here to be your chaplain.
- My what?

1115
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,245
Chaplain. I was sent to help you.

1116
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:49,089
A-ten-hut!

1117
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,258
Adams!

1118
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:55,220
Sir, yes, sir. Is there a problem?

1119
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:58,806
One of your girls here
has the initials JMB.

1120
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:02,226
And that JMB returned
a very important letter to sender

1121
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,103
that I am just now receiving.

1122
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:06,730
The name of the recipient
on that envelope is illegible.

1123
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:09,901
I can see my Army number
as clear as day. Can you?

1124
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:14,572
Or maybe you can't read numbers.

1125
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:16,741
It's a damn shame.

1126
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:21,996
I'm only gonna ask you
one more time. Who is JMB?

1127
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,665
That would be me, sir.

1128
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:29,587
You?

1129
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,843
Damn, girl. Are you stupid?

1130
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,971
No, sir, I am not.

1131
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:42,017
Then why would you send this letter back
after so much time?

1132
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:44,435
You must be stupid.

1133
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,730
All of you must be stupid!

1134
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:51,943
You can't send a little letter
to who it belongs to?

1135
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,863
- Can you read or write?
- Yes, sir, we can.

1136
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,197
I'm talking to this gal.

1137
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,408
I know, but as her commanding officer,
it is my res--

1138
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:00,952
Shut up, Adams!

1139
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:05,248
Can you hear me? Answer the question!

1140
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:08,710
Yes, sir!

1141
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:11,921
I can hear you.

1142
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:20,721
You've been here for two months,
and nothing's done.

1143
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:23,766
What the hell kind of operation
are you running here?

1144
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:25,434
I'm going straight to General Halt

1145
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:28,353
and telling him to shut
this clown show down right now.

1146
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:32,400
This is ridiculous. What a waste of time.
Where do they find these people?

1147
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:39,365
At ease.

1148
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,744
Back to work, ladies.

1149
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:44,829
Wait, wait, wait!

1150
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,960
Ladies, I don't care what anybody says.

1151
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:53,796
You have been doing a fine job,

1152
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,633
even in these circumstances.

1153
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,387
But a lot of the mail is being returned,

1154
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,722
and that is disappointing.

1155
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:06,391
I've been watching the process.

1156
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:09,603
I have a pretty high-level understanding
of what's going on,

1157
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,398
but I need you to tell me
from your point of view.

1158
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:18,195
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1159
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,614
One at a time.

1160
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,033
You first.

1161
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:26,537
Ma'am, at last count,
we have over 7,500 Robert Smiths.

1162
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,080
There are so many locator cards

1163
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,249
that we have to try and find
the last one by date.

1164
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,251
And sometimes, it's illegible.

1165
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,961
Not to mention it's so cold,

1166
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,338
and some of us
have to work with these gloves on.

1167
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:40,217
A lot of these care packages are molded.
Even the rats are biting through them.

1168
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,720
They've even eaten
through the names on the envelopes.

1169
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:45,597
Sometimes, it's just one or two words.

1170
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,767
It's like some kind
of crazy crossword puzzle.

1171
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:51,396
Now, Vera, you love a crossword puzzle.

1172
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,773
- Yes, ma'am.
- Think you could take a look at those?

1173
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:57,151
- See if maybe you can help out with that?
- I will.

1174
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,946
Dolores, you were at the movie theater
every weekend watching the newsreel.

1175
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:04,366
If we can make out where it originated,
can you tell us what's going on there?

1176
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,243
Yes. And if I can see when it was sent,

1177
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:08,912
I might be able to tell you
where a unit was headed.

1178
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,622
Well, that might help.

1179
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:12,916
Some of these letters
are to Joe-Joe or Bubba.

1180
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,627
Well, in those cases,
just open the envelopes.

1181
01:26:15,628 --> 01:26:18,213
See if there's any clues
that can tell you who they are.

1182
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:21,300
Well, with some of the packages,
like clothes and things?

1183
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,511
I worked at the Garment District
in California.

1184
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:26,972
I know fabrics well. I can help with that.

1185
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:30,058
Ma'am? I was a postmaster
in North Carolina.

1186
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:32,936
I was a mortician
at my daddy's funeral home.

1187
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:35,063
Girl, how's that supposed to help us?

1188
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:37,065
You notice I didn't say my best skill.

1189
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:38,067
Johnnie Mae.

1190
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:04,719
I know this is a solemn time,
as we have lost a great man.

1191
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:09,182
President Roosevelt
was a man that led us well,

1192
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:12,310
and leadership is important.

1193
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,811
It is my prayer that President Truman

1194
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:18,023
will always show
that same great leadership.

1195
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:19,734
But in order to lead,

1196
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,528
you have to be qualified.

1197
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:29,117
In Proverbs 4:14, it reads,

1198
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:31,454
"Enter not into the path of the wicked

1199
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:35,333
and go not the way of evil men."

1200
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:39,379
Well, that word can also be exchanged

1201
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:42,006
for evil women.

1202
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,344
As I pray for many of you,
I know it's hard.

1203
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:51,181
You are not up to being here,
and you are being led by someone

1204
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,977
who is not capable
in the eyes of the Army,

1205
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:58,438
nor is she qualified morally
in the eyes of the Lord.

1206
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,275
It is a shame that on Friday night,

1207
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,237
every bulb in this place
is shining brightly,

1208
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:09,158
but on Sunday morning,
there is a burnt-out bulb above my head.

1209
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,786
That is not the Lord's work.

1210
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:16,666
You have to be careful
when you are being led by evil.

1211
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:21,003
It will cause you to miss
important things.

1212
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:25,800
Let us pray.

1213
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:39,062
So he says,

1214
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:42,774
"I know such an assignment is probably not
what you had in mind, but I guaran--"

1215
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:44,110
Those are my things.

1216
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:47,029
"Dear General Halt,

1217
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:50,282
the women of the Six Triple Eight
are horribly wicked."

1218
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:53,618
"They are led by an evil woman
who promotes debauchery,

1219
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:56,955
as she is running
the King Edward School like a brothel."

1220
01:28:56,956 --> 01:29:00,084
- I said those are my things.
- Yes, as are those, by your feet.

1221
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:02,669
You will be leaving here today.

1222
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,838
I was sent here by General Halt.

1223
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:07,007
I don't care
if the good Lord himself sent you.

1224
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:09,426
Now, I don't know if you know this,

1225
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,137
but I am the daughter of a preacher.

1226
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:15,182
I know the Bible from Genesis
to Revelations and backwards.

1227
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:19,395
I am a woman of faith
and tremendous character,

1228
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:23,107
and I lead these women with a stern hand

1229
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:27,444
and the love and understanding
that I would think a chaplain should.

1230
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:30,906
Now, I have had to endure
the hissing and backstabbing

1231
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,449
of white men in the military.

1232
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,786
I have learned every law in this Army

1233
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:38,955
to defend myself
and to get to where I am now,

1234
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:40,874
so if you think I am afraid of you

1235
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,919
or whatever you can write
in a letter to anyone,

1236
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,882
then you are as wrong as you were
in that so-called sermon today.

1237
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:52,094
This soldier here will take you
wherever you want to go,

1238
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,430
but you will be on your way right now.

1239
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,601
Can she help you with your bags?

1240
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:14,867
Why would they send a chaplain?

1241
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:20,163
Well... on the night
that we're hosting the soldiers,

1242
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:21,707
you know what that is.

1243
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,543
- I think--
- Shh.

1244
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:27,380
That's a V-1.

1245
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:45,690
Come on now!

1246
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,950
Careful, careful! Go, go, go!

1247
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:10,714
Get down.

1248
01:31:58,554 --> 01:31:59,554
Major Adams?

1249
01:31:59,555 --> 01:32:00,890
What is it, Private?

1250
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,727
Are those the coordinates
where the soldiers are?

1251
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,690
Yes. But understand you're not
supposed to be looking this close.

1252
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:12,651
That's why they are all redacting them.

1253
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:14,820
We can't have this get into enemy hands.

1254
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:22,745
A symbol...

1255
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:25,915
is drawn on it.

1256
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:32,922
And... this letter's from a few weeks ago.

1257
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,175
And in this letter...

1258
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,388
it mentions, uh, the Indian head.

1259
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:44,225
These hand-drawn clues

1260
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:48,895
are how the soldiers are secretly
letting their families know

1261
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:50,730
what part of the world they in.

1262
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:56,361
Private, each one of the divisions
of our soldiers has 16,000 men in it.

1263
01:32:56,362 --> 01:33:00,700
You just located 48,000 of them.

1264
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:07,581
Ladies, how many of you have seen
hand-drawn symbols on the letters

1265
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,500
that resemble the division patches
of our soldiers?

1266
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:11,835
Hold up your hands.

1267
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,929
That's very good work, Private.

1268
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:26,976
Mm-hm.

1269
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,703
Johnnie Mae is gonna have a fit
when we get all this mail.

1270
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,539
She needs to settle down.

1271
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,170
We don't have time for this!

1272
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:57,172
- Vera, we have to stay on the route.
- Whoa!

1273
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,757
- And be here all day?
- No!

1274
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:02,011
We got some good momentum going.
I'm not gonna be the one to break it.

1275
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:06,723
Stop! No, stop!

1276
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:07,724
What?

1277
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:12,021
I... I think we are over a UXB.

1278
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:14,064
You sure?

1279
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:17,777
Oh my God.

1280
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:24,784
What do we... What do we do?

1281
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:29,538
What Major Adams trained us to do.

1282
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:34,418
We need to evacuate the truck,
but we stick to our training.

1283
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:37,296
Okay.

1284
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:41,217
Y'all slowly get off the truck.

1285
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:44,303
Slowly!

1286
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,060
One.

1287
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:53,145
- Two.
- Two.

1288
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:55,898
- Three!
- Three!

1289
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:11,747
Oh my Lord.

1290
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,207
What is it?

1291
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:14,791
Look.

1292
01:35:22,591 --> 01:35:23,467
Lena.

1293
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:26,846
Y'all better look like you're working.

1294
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:30,099
Oh, you gonna wanna see this.

1295
01:35:51,495 --> 01:35:54,248
- Are you going to read it?
- Would you give her a second?

1296
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:57,917
Ladies.

1297
01:35:57,918 --> 01:36:00,129
Major Adams wants to see us.

1298
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,506
There's been an accident.

1299
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:25,154
So the Army is not even gonna bury them?

1300
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:28,115
I was told no.

1301
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:32,036
I'm so sorry, ladies.

1302
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:36,372
Now, I will get word back
to the United States to ask for help,

1303
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:38,833
but in the meantime,
we are taking up this collection

1304
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:41,419
because we will not allow our soldiers

1305
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:45,424
to be denied the dignity
of a proper burial.

Private.

Yes, ma'am.

1315
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,757
There are
many American soldiers buried here.

1316
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:12,511
If you know the day he died
and the unit he was in,

1317
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:14,346
you can find him here.

1318
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:24,273
Can he bring you back to base?

1319
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:27,443
Yes, ma'am.

1320
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,989
Go on then.

1321
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,003
Hey.

1322
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:50,883
Can you wait for me?

1323
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:53,677
Sure.

1324
01:39:53,904 --> 01:39:56,531
I knew I'd find you. I knew it.

1325
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,607
<i>Dear Miss Lena,</i>

1326
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:34,695
<i>vector niner, niner here.</i>

1327
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,116
<i>I don't wanna cause you concern,</i>

1328
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:43,411
<i>but for the first time, I think
that the reality of me not making it home</i>

1329
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:44,663
<i>may be sinking in.</i>

1330
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:48,667
<i>I know I asked you to wait for me,</i>

1331
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:52,796
<i>and knowing you, you will.</i>

1332
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:55,799
<i>But...</i>

1333
01:40:57,634 --> 01:40:59,094
<i>if I don't make it back,</i>

1334
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:03,682
<i>please live your life with the laughter
that you had in that rumble seat,</i>

1335
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,060
{\an8}<i>that kind of freedom and fun.</i>

1336
01:41:10,105 --> 01:41:12,608
<i>Promise me
you will live a long life.</i>

1337
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:15,319
<i>Long enough for the both of us.</i>

1338
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:19,865
<i>Promise me you will laugh enough
for the both of us.</i>

1339
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:24,243
<i>I truly love you, Lena Derriecott.</i>

1340
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:26,496
I love you too, Abram David.

1341
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,498
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1342
01:41:29,124 --> 01:41:32,461
<i>I'm sorry I never had the courage
to say it sooner than that night.</i>

1343
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,590
<i>Look for me in the skies.</i>

1344
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:39,676
<i>Yours forever...</i>

1345
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:42,346
<i>Abram.</i>

1346
01:43:11,059 --> 01:43:12,018
At ease.

1347
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:12,978
Morning, sir.

1348
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,941
General Lee tells me
that you're making progress.

1349
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:19,359
Yes, sir.

1350
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:22,278
Even though we just lost
two of our soldiers.

1351
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:24,198
Well, yeah. Well, that happens.

1352
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:28,035
As for the progress
of the mail, I disagree.

1353
01:43:29,494 --> 01:43:32,915
Not one of my troops
has seen a bit of your progress.

1354
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:38,085
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
We are working as fast as we can.

1355
01:43:38,086 --> 01:43:39,713
Clearly not fast enough.

1356
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:48,888
This cannot be your entire battalion.

1357
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,056
No, sir.

1358
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:53,726
We work 24-hour shifts,
so some of our women are resting.

1359
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,187
- They're resting?
- Yes, sir.

1360
01:43:55,687 --> 01:43:59,024
I'm here to inspect your troops,
and your troop's not here.

1361
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:00,983
That make sense, Major?

1362
01:44:00,984 --> 01:44:01,985
Well, sir, I--

1363
01:44:26,468 --> 01:44:27,511
A beauty parlor?

1364
01:44:29,763 --> 01:44:30,597
Yes, sir.

1365
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:35,227
This is no way to spend the Army's money.

1366
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:44,319
So you are telling me

1367
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,572
that they got time to get their hair done,

1368
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:53,537
but they do not have time
to be inspected by their general?

1369
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,000
Oh, no, sir, I'm-- I--

1370
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:02,253
I'm so sorry, but in there
we have our night-shift women,

1371
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:03,964
and they are asleep.

1372
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:14,266
Now, sir, those are our showers,
and my ladies are showering.

1373
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:17,644
- Lee.
- Yes, sir?

1374
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:21,981
Did you not tell this woman
that I was coming for an inspection?

1375
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:22,899
Yes, sir.

1376
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:26,945
And does the major
not understand that inspection

1377
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:29,405
is whatever I wanna inspect?

1378
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:31,366
Yes, sir. She does.

1379
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:35,537
This how you run a company?

1380
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:42,085
What about that room?

1381
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,212
May I go in that room?

1382
01:45:45,255 --> 01:45:47,256
Yes, sir. That is our delivery room.

1383
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:48,508
Well, thank you.

1384
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:50,427
Of course, sir.

1385
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:01,271
Attention!

1386
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:24,669
What's this mess?

1387
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:28,381
Well, sir, some of the packages
were chewed in half by vermin,

1388
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:29,715
and the contents separated.

1389
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:31,884
Our soldiers have come up
with a way to figure out

1390
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:34,471
which item belongs to which by the fabric.

1391
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:57,410
Now, this here is where
we are able to match the letters

1392
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:00,330
with the soldiers
that have the same first and last name.

1393
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:03,791
Now, wouldn't it be simpler
just to use their number?

1394
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:06,085
Well, yes, sir,
that is what we tried at first.

1395
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,879
Some of them are addressed
to nicknames, so we had to do research

1396
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,008
to make sure that they end up
with the right soldier.

1397
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:19,306
Wasting more of the Army's money
on perfume?

1398
01:47:19,307 --> 01:47:20,474
No, sir.

1399
01:47:20,475 --> 01:47:24,603
When we couldn't make out the names,
because some of them were smudged, um...

1400
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:27,648
Some women writing letters
spray them with their favorite perfume,

1401
01:47:27,649 --> 01:47:31,152
and, well, some of our soldiers
were able to recognize those perfumes.

1402
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:32,069
It was a chore,

1403
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:35,322
but we were able to match the sender
with the state where that perfume was sold

1404
01:47:35,323 --> 01:47:36,616
and then trace it back.

1405
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:43,874
Step aside, gal.

1406
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:52,673
Are you opening and reading this mail?

1407
01:47:52,674 --> 01:47:56,011
Sir, only in the case
where we cannot locate the soldier, sir.

1408
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:57,971
Are you kidding me?

1409
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:03,726
Y'all opening and reading
the letters of these white soldiers?

1410
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:06,270
Sir, sometimes,
that is the only way to get the clues

1411
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:07,814
to find out where they might be.

1412
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:10,358
This is private, Major.

1413
01:48:11,985 --> 01:48:14,654
Have you lost
what's little left of your mind?

1414
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,700
Tried to go over my head,

1415
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:21,660
get soldiers buried that you had killed.

1416
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:24,539
You got them killed
'cause you did not train them well.

1417
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,334
So now,

1418
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:30,962
President Roosevelt has died,

1419
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:35,467
this little experiment
gonna be shut down immediately.

1420
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:41,348
I think I'm gonna
have you relieved of your duties.

1421
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:46,060
And I'm gonna bring
a white lieutenant in here

1422
01:48:46,061 --> 01:48:47,812
to show you how to run this unit!

1423
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:52,484
Over my dead body, sir.

1424
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,163
What did you say?

1425
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:10,377
Sir, with all due respect,

1426
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:14,756
my battalion is working day and night
in horrible conditions.

1427
01:49:15,465 --> 01:49:17,551
We have no heat most of the time.

1428
01:49:18,677 --> 01:49:23,055
Gets so cold that the women have to put
the water in helmets to wash themselves.

1429
01:49:23,056 --> 01:49:27,269
You gave us this place to turn into
a barracks with no bed and no help.

1430
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:30,688
And my women are harassed,
and then they are befriended

1431
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:34,316
only to be asked if they have
tails under their skirts after midnight

1432
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:36,777
because of the rumors of white soldiers.

1433
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:40,823
You sent a chaplain, not to pray,
but to spy on us.

1434
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:44,910
We just lost two soldiers to a UXB
who were highly trained,

1435
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:46,787
and I know because I trained them.

1436
01:49:46,788 --> 01:49:51,041
And you wouldn't even give the orders
for them to have a proper burial.

1437
01:49:51,042 --> 01:49:55,337
Now, I know we are fighting a war,
but our war starts with being Negro.

1438
01:49:55,338 --> 01:49:58,048
We are fighting on every front.

1439
01:49:58,049 --> 01:50:03,430
So as I said, sir, over my dead body, sir.

1440
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,098
He's gonna court-martial me.

1441
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:52,770
I... I... I feel like such a hypocrite

1442
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:56,941
telling these women to maintain
their dignity and decorum.

1443
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:00,986
I don't know what came over me.

1444
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:02,989
You was thinking you were right.

1445
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:06,242
He was rude,
acting like we haven't done a thing.

1446
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:10,246
But he is my superior officer.
I know better than that.

1447
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:13,582
Ma'am. I'm sorry, but we have a problem.

1448
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:15,501
The women have stopped working.

1449
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:16,544
Why?

1450
01:51:17,212 --> 01:51:18,088
I don't know.

1451
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:24,386
Back to work, ladies!

1452
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:28,598
Get to work!

1453
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:56,459
Get to work!

1454
01:52:29,492 --> 01:52:32,995
I know that Roosevelt
was a sympathizer and all,

1455
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:36,166
but I need you to talk to Truman.
I mean, nothing's been done.

1456
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:41,795
You will tell the president
that this is the worst mistake.

1457
01:52:45,091 --> 01:52:48,761
And that Adams gal? Yeah.

1458
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:50,471
I want her court-martialed.

1459
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:55,350
Oh, she said it, Marshal.
She said it to my face!

1460
01:52:57,228 --> 01:52:59,856
And them reading the white soldiers' mail...

1461
01:53:03,902 --> 01:53:07,070
Just a second. What's going on out there?

1462
01:53:07,071 --> 01:53:09,407
The men are receiving their mail, sir.

1463
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:19,041

1464

01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:02,835
- Frank!
- Yes, sir, here!

1477
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,127
Mail for Troutman!

1478
01:54:04,128 --> 01:54:05,629
- Troutman!
- Yeah!

1479
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:20,895
Here you go.

1480
01:54:40,164 --> 01:54:40,999
